# AmazonClone
I developed an Amazon clone website using HTML and external CSS in Visual Studio Code Editor. The project incorporates images, hyperlinks, Font Awesome libraries, Flexbox etc to enhance functionality. This fully self-built site demonstrates my proficiency in clean coding and best practices.
